      user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/

  <!--
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

<!-- Q: Is it that inside of body is where the first scope of css rules applies? This is 
        where scripts, style sheets, and HTML elements will load according to the JS. Is it that 
        putting the first layer of CSS rules at this level allows the app to be responsive to 
        whatever DOM is it being rendered on? -->

      The build step will place the bundled scripts into the <body> tag.

      To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
      To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
