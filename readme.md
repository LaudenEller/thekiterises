# Project Title

MERN App for Marketing Agency Website Migration

## Project Overview

This project involved migrating a marketing agency website from Wix to a MERN stack using Mongoose Atlas. The initial attempt to use the Wix source code as a template led to a complex CSS puzzle. As a result, the CSS was redesigned using Figma and Flex Box to create a responsive website with optimal user experience.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-app.git`
2. Install dependencies for both the client and server using `npm install` in the root directory.
3. In a separate terminal window, navigate to the server directory using `cd server`.
4. Start the server using `npm start`.
5. In a separate terminal window, navigate to the client directory using `cd client`.
6. Start the client using `npm start`.
7. Access the app at `http://localhost:3000/`.
